# OSSV Testing Framework

A comprehensive scientific testing framework for evaluating the OSS Vulnerability Scanner (ossv-scanner) project.

## Overview

This testing framework provides a rigorous, methodical approach to evaluate the capabilities, performance, and accuracy of the OSS Vulnerability Scanner. It implements various testing methodologies to provide quantitative metrics and scientific analysis.

## Features

- **Benchmark Testing**: Evaluate against established security frameworks like NIST and OWASP
- **Controlled Testing**: Test against known vulnerabilities with precise measurement
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed performance profiling under various conditions
- **Comparative Testing**: Compare against other vulnerability scanning tools
- **Statistical Analysis**: Apply robust statistical methods to evaluate results
- **Visualization**: Generate comprehensive visual reports and dashboards
- **Integration Testing**: Verify integrations with CI/CD pipelines and development tools
- **Demo Capabilities**: Build structured demonstrations for presentations

## Installation
